I just published some beautiful animated visualizations for popular machine learning algorithms, built with the awesome `R` package [animation](https://github.com/yihui/animation). Take a look at them: [Machine Learning Animations](https://davpinto.github.io/ml-simulations). They help to understand parameter tuning and algorithm convergence. You can find the source code in my [GitHub](https://github.com/davpinto/ml-simulations). I will be constantly adding new animations!
